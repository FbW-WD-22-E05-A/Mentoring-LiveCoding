/**
 * Real life task that requires nested loops.
 * 
 * You are given an array of words which can be reordered
 * so that each word in the array differs by only one letter
 * from the word before it an after it. You are to write a
 * function which does this.
 * 
 * Create a new array which starts with the first word,
 * and add words from the input array to this new array
 * in the correct order.
 * 
 * Write your function to ensure that it works with the
 * short `failToPass` array, and then test that it is
 * generic by calling it with the `secondArray`.
